# Portfolio1

Basic-Portfolio
A professional portfolio that gives information about myself and it illustrates my web-development abilities plus links that give access to my repositories and my social media. In addition to that, I have included a contact form for people to be able to contact me. The website is mainly done with bootstrap and it is responsive on various screentypes. I have implemented my own customizations as well in order to make the look and feel of the web page adhere to my personality accordingly.
